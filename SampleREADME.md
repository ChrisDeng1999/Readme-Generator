## Description
I wanted to create a application that allows users to create a professional ReadMe file. I built this project to assist users in created a professional ReadMe file. My application allows users who have trouble creating their own ReadMe files to have a nice template to work off of. I learned how to use inquirer as well as fs to generate and populate a ReadMe file.
